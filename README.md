Crowd counting is one of the important research
topic in the field of computer vision. There are several methods
used for this task like multi-column convolution neural network
(MCNN) and achieved great performance. But, they can be
improved with the inclusion of global density feature map.
Pretrained model can also be used as a part of the model to try
and improve the performance. In this paper, I have implemented
two models that are MCNN model with global density feature
and VGG19 based transfer learning model. ShanghaiTech dataset
was used for this task.
Keywords: Global density feature, convolutional neural network, crowd counting, VGG19.
